# Tic Tac Toe AI bot

This is self learning Tic-Tac-Toe game . Where first player tries to win and second player

tries to defend. 

I used min-max algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. 

and created game UI to play against self-learned AI. 

commands (in project folder):

```bash
python train.py
npm install
npm start
```
