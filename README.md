# tic-tak-toe-v2.0

          This is self learning Tic-Tac-Toe game . Where first player tries to win and second player
          tries to defend.

          I used min-max algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.

          and created game ui to play against self-learned AI.

          First run train.py

              A text file will be created of name 'train_data.txt' which contains what
              step should be taken in a game situation.

              Next run index.js using electron framework

        electron-framework - https://electronjs.org/
